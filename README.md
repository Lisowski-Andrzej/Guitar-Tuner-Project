# **Guitar-Tuner-Based-on-Signal-Analysis**

## Description
The Guitar Tuner is a MATLAB-based tool designed to assist musicians in tuning their guitar strings with high precision. 
By analyzing the input signal frequency from each guitar string, this tool identifies whether the stringâ€™s pitch is in tune, too low, or too high, 
and provides actionable feedback to help achieve accurate tuning.
## Features
- Real-time analysis of audio signals from guitar strings.
- Frequency detection and comparison with standard tuning frequencies.
- Clear feedback indicating whether each string is in tune, too high, or too low.
- User-friendly interface for simple and efficient tuning.
